Note: Data used in these projects is for demonstration purposes only.

## Data Science Projects:
- [Explainable Hostel Recommender System](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Explainable_Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): This Recommender System recommends similar hostels with an explanation and as a result, such recommendations become more effective and more persuasive.
- [Content Based Recommender System For Hostels in Ireland (Based on Hostel's Attributes)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): I created a content based recommender system for hostels in Ireland that recommends similar hostels by matching the contextual features and multi-rating data of other hostels with the anchor hostel.
- [Content Based Recommender System For Hostels in Ireland (Based on Hostel's Name)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/hostel_recommender_system_based_on_hostel_name.ipynb): This Recommender System Uses the name of a hostel to recommend similar hostels.
- [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/titanic/titanic.ipynb): The goal of this project to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive in the disaster.
- [Support Vector Machines: Predict a Pulsar Star](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/pulsar_star/support_vector_machines.ipynb): Our main goal is to predict pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis using SVM.
- [Predicting Black Friday Purchase Prices](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/black_friday/black_friday.ipynb): The challenge is to predict purchase prices of different products purchased by customers based on historical purchase data.
- [Market Bucket Optimization](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/association_rule_learning/apriori_groceries.ipynb): The challenge is to create association rules using Apriori algorithm to optimize bucket of a grocery store.
- [Customer Segments using K-means](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/kmeans_clustering/customer_segments_kmeans.ipynb): Creating customer segments using K-means clustering.
- Feature Selection for a dataset of predicting central neuropathic pain (PCNP) : In this project, a dataset of predicting central neuropathic pain (PCNP) is provided which has 432 features. The task is to apply different feature selection methods to this dataset so that overall performance can be increased. Three methods of feature selection are performed on this dataset so that the performance can be increased. These three feature selection methods are filtering, wrapper and embedding methods. For this experiment, both techniques of embedding methods i.e L1, Lasso, and L2, Ridge are used, and then the results are compared in the end.

_Tools Used in Data Science Projects: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy

## Web Projects:
- [Nicholas Jose Website](http://www.nicholasjose.com.au/): The goal was to develop a website in WordPress but the content should load without page refresh using AJAX.
Tools: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, WordPress
- [Mighty Host Website](http://mightyhost.com.au/): I did PSD to HTML and CSS.
- [Fish Recruiting Website](http://fishrecruiting.com.au/): I did PSD to HTML CSS and applied Jquery to the design.
