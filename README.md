Note: Data used in these projects is for demonstration purposes only.

## Web Projects:

i have completed more than 100 web pojects. 10 out of those are mentioned here.
Note: Some of these web projects are linking to archive version of the website (My Work) because client recently changed the website and that recent work in not mine.

1. [Mighty Host Website](http://mightyhost.com.au/): I did PSD to HTML and CSS.
2. [Fish Recruiting Website](http://fishrecruiting.com.au/): I did PSD to HTML CSS and applied Jquery to the design.
3. [Café Galilee Website](http://cafe-galilee.com/): I did PSD to HTML and CSS in this project.
4. [Nicholas Jose Website](http://www.nicholasjose.com.au/): The goal was to develop a website in WordPress but the content should load without page refresh using AJAX.
Tools: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, WordPress
5. [4 Life](https://web.archive.org/web/20120222005048/http://4lifetraining.com.au/): I did PSD to HTML and CSS and then developed the dynamic website using Adobe Business Catalyst
- [Bike Sharing Website] : Road congestion, traffic, air pollution, increased greenhouse gas emissions combined with the cost of maintenance of cars has provoked the need for alternative modes of transportation, one of them being bikes. Best utilized in bike-sharing schemes, these are environmentally inclined, cost-optimized mode of transportation which combines active transportation with public transit. In bike-sharing schemes, owning a bike is not necessary as these schemes allow the users to rent, pay for their used duration and return the bike to the nearest collection center after the completion of their trip. The basis of this bike-sharing schemes are to provide tourists with a resident-like experience and students quick access to schools and vital resources of proximity to them, whilst providing an efficient alternative mode of transportation for inhabitants. Implementing these schemes and keeping a tab of all the transactions and activities such as point of order and returns, missing bikes, bike repairs, etc. is an arduous task. This project focuses on providing a system that enables the users to utilize the service with ease with the flexibility to operators for monitoring all required activities. The system would use a database containing information on the bikes, drop-off locations, and the customers. It is built to be user-friendly and flexible along with maximizing the efficiency for the operators and managers while easing customer stress.

## Data Science Projects:
- [Explainable Hostel Recommender System](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Explainable_Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): This Recommender System recommends similar hostels with an explanation and as a result, such recommendations become more effective and more persuasive.
- [Content Based Recommender System For Hostels in Ireland (Based on Hostel's Attributes)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): I created a content based recommender system for hostels in Ireland that recommends similar hostels by matching the contextual features and multi-rating data of other hostels with the anchor hostel.
- [Content Based Recommender System For Hostels in Ireland (Based on Hostel's Name)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/hostel_recommender_system_based_on_hostel_name.ipynb): This Recommender System Uses the name of a hostel to recommend similar hostels.
- [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/titanic/titanic.ipynb): The goal of this project to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive in the disaster.
- [Support Vector Machines: Predict a Pulsar Star](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/pulsar_star/support_vector_machines.ipynb): Our main goal is to predict pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis using SVM.
- [Predicting Black Friday Purchase Prices](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/black_friday/black_friday.ipynb): The challenge is to predict purchase prices of different products purchased by customers based on historical purchase data.
- [Market Bucket Optimization](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/association_rule_learning/apriori_groceries.ipynb): The challenge is to create association rules using Apriori algorithm to optimize bucket of a grocery store.
- [Customer Segments using K-means](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/kmeans_clustering/customer_segments_kmeans.ipynb): Creating customer segments using K-means clustering.
- [Feature Selection for a dataset of predicting central neuropathic pain (PCNP)] : In this project, a dataset of predicting central neuropathic pain (PCNP) is provided which has 432 features. The task is to apply different feature selection methods to this dataset so that overall performance can be increased. Three methods of feature selection are performed on this dataset so that the performance can be increased. These three feature selection methods are filtering, wrapper and embedding methods. For this experiment, both techniques of embedding methods i.e L1, Lasso, and L2, Ridge are used, and then the results are compared in the end.
- [Explainable Travel Partner Recommender System Using BERT]
- [Identify Different Types of Cell Nuclei in a Colon Cancer Sample using Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/shahzadqureshi/competitions) : Designed and Trained a Deep Neural Network(CNN) model for multi‑class classification problem on 64x64 images with cell nuclei at the center. Performed Hyperparameter Tuning. Tools Used: Python, Pytorch, Scikit‑Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- [Subreddit Post Sentiment Classification] : Sentiment analysis in contextual problems is basically identifying the text and classifying it into social sentiments in order to get subjective information. Different brands use sentiment analysis commonly to get an overview of wider public opinions on different topics from their social media pages. Moreover, sentiment analysis also known as emotion Artificial Intelligence or opinion mining is a very popular tool being used by many E-commerce brands for understanding a large number of reviews of their products as it helps in quickly get an overview of public opinion without going to read all the reviews. In this project, a dataset of Reddit is provided. Reddit provides deep discussion on different topics that is not very common in other social networks. Reddit has threads that demonstrate the topics of discussion. A thread may contain different posts from different users. The task is to correctly classify these posts for sentiment analysis.

_Tools Used in Data Science Projects: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy
