## Web Development Projects:

I have developed more than 100 web development projects including both front-end and back-end projects. Some of those are mentioned here.

**Note:** Some of these web projects are linking to an archive version of the website (My Work) because the client recently changed the website and that recent work is not mine.

16. [Travel Buddy (Recommender Systems)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Recommender_System_Models.ipynb): Created a website that allows people to find alike people to travel with. Used TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, Word2Vec, and BERT algorithms to find matching people based on the data available.

## Data Science Projects:

**Note:** Data used in these projects is for demonstration purposes only.

1. [Explainable Hostel Recommender System](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Explainable_Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): This Recommender System recommends similar hostels with an explanation and as a result, such recommendations become more effective and more persuasive.
2. [Content Based Recommender System For Hostels in Ireland (Based on Hostel's Attributes)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): I created a content-based recommender system for hostels in Ireland that recommends similar hostels by matching the contextual features and multi-rating data of other hostels with the anchor hostel.
3. [Content Based Recommender System For Hostels in Ireland (Based on Hostel's Name)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/hostel_recommender_system_based_on_hostel_name.ipynb): This Recommender System Uses the name of a hostel to recommend similar hostels.
4. [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/titanic/titanic.ipynb): The goal of this project was to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive in the disaster.
5. [Support Vector Machines: Predict a Pulsar Star](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/pulsar_star/support_vector_machines.ipynb): Our main goal is to predict pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis using SVM.
6. [Predicting Black Friday Purchase Prices](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/black_friday/black_friday.ipynb): The challenge is to predict purchase prices of different products purchased by customers based on historical purchase data.
7. [Market Bucket Optimization](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/association_rule_learning/apriori_groceries.ipynb): The challenge is to create association rules using the Apriori algorithm to optimize bucket of a grocery store.
8. [Customer Segments using K-means](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/kmeans_clustering/customer_segments_kmeans.ipynb): Creating customer segments using K-means clustering.
9. [Feature Selection for a dataset of predicting central neuropathic pain (PCNP)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/ml-feature-selection/fs.ipynb): In this project, a dataset of predicting central neuropathic pain (PCNP) is provided which has 432 features. The task is to apply different feature selection methods to this dataset so that overall performance can be increased. Three methods of feature selection are performed on this dataset so that the performance can be increased. These three feature selection methods are filtering wrapper and embedding methods. For this experiment, both techniques of embedding methods i.e. L1, Lasso, and L2, Ridge are used, and then the results are compared in the end.
10. [Identify Different Types of Cell Nuclei in a Colon Cancer Sample using Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/shahzadqureshi/competitions): Designed and Trained a Deep Neural Network (CNN) model for multi‑class classification problem on 64x64 images with cell nuclei at the center. Performed regularization, hyperparameter tuning, and data augmentation to improve results. Tools Used: Python, Pytorch, Scikit‑Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
11. [Subreddit Post Sentiment Classification](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/post-sentiment-classification/psc.ipynb): Sentiment analysis in contextual problems is basically identifying the text and classifying it into social sentiments in order to get subjective information. Different brands use sentiment analysis to get an overview of wider public opinions on different topics from their social media pages. Moreover, sentiment analysis also known as emotion Artificial Intelligence or opinion mining is a very popular tool being used by many E-commerce brands for understanding a large number of reviews of their products as it helps quickly get an overview of public opinion without going to read all the reviews. In this project, a dataset of Reddit is provided. Reddit provides deep discussion on different topics that are not very common in other social networks. Reddit has threads that demonstrate the topics of discussion. A thread may contain different posts from different users. The task is to correctly classify these posts for sentiment analysis.
12. [Travel Buddy (Recommender Systems)](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Recommender_System_Models.ipynb): Created a website that allows people to find alike people to travel with. Used TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, Word2Vec, and BERT algorithms to find matching people based on the data available.

_Tools Used in Data Science Projects: sci-kit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy
