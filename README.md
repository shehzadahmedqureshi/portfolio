# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects.
Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.

## Machine Learning Projects:
- [Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://github.com/ubaidullahbutt/portfolio/blob/master/titanic/titanic.ipynb): The goal of this project to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive in the disaster.
- [Support Vector Machines: Predict a Pulsar Star](https://github.com/ubaidullahbutt/portfolio/blob/master/pulsar_star/support_vector_machines.ipynb): Our main goal is to predict pulsar candidates for facilitate rapid analysis using SVM.
- [Predicting Black Friday Purchase Prices](https://github.com/ubaidullahbutt/portfolio/blob/master/black_friday/black_friday.ipynb): The challenge is to predict purchase prices of different products purchased by customers based on historical purchase data.
- [Market Bucket Optimization](https://github.com/ubaidullahbutt/portfolio/blob/master/association_rule_learning/apriori_groceries.ipynb): The challenge is to create association rules using Apriori algorithm to optimize bucket of a grocery store.
- [Unsupervised Learning: Customer Segments using K-means](https://github.com/ubaidullahbutt/portfolio/blob/master/kmeans_clustering/customer_segments_kmeans.ipynb): Creating customer segments using K-means clustering.
- [Ireland Hostel Recommender System](https://github.com/shehzadahmedqureshi/portfolio/blob/master/Hostel_Recommender_System.ipynb): Created a content based hostel recommender system which recommends hostels in a city if a city's hostel is being viewed.
